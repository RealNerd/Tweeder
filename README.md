# Tweeder

Tweeder is a simple iOS project demonstrating some general concepts that might be found in an app similar to the Twitter app. The primary goals were to demonstrate the following ideas:

- Account creation and login
- Displaying a list of _tweets_ or messages made by the current user
- Refreshing the list with *only* tweets that have not been fetched from the server before
- Posting a new tweet
